## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:

- Edit this page in `src/pages/index.astro`
- Edit the site header items in `src/components/Header.astro`
- Add your name to the footer in `src/components/Footer.astro`
- Check out the included blog posts in `src/pages/blog/`
- Customize the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
