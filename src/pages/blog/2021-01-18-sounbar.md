The Bessel array is a configuration for a set of transducers that makes multiple elements in a line array pattern like a single transducer. In other words, what separates a Bessel array from a traditional line array is that the Bessel array produces very omnidirectional sound. A good overview of the topic can be found in D. B. Keeles paper, [Effective Performance of Bessel Arrays](/posts/besselarray_soundbar/Keele_Bessel_Arrays.pdf). The Bessel Array is created by changing the polarity of transducers in a line array as dictated by the Bessel function. An interesting property of the 7 elements Bessel array is that the transducer in the middle of the array is not driven at all, therefore it is possible to completely remove this element from the array. This forms a space in which another driver could be placed.

Ratios for a 5 element Bessel array
+0.5 -1 +1 +1 +0.5

Ratios for a 7 element Bessel array
-0.5 +1 -1 0 +1 +1 +0.5

Ratios for a 9 element Bessel array
0.5 -1 +1 0 -1 0 +1 +1 +0.5

In Matlab, I simulated the polar patterns for 7 element Bessel array and a traditional 7 element line array. In the diagrams, 90 degree is parallel with the face of the speaker.

The ability to position such an array horizontally makes it a good candidate for a soundbar which is what I was seeking to design when starting this project. This soundbar prototype uses a 7 element Bessel array and the empty space is replaced by an 8inch horn attached to JBL D2 compression driver. The drivers used for the array were cheap generic 6inch speakers. The Bessel array worked great, and more measurements are to come. The horn used did not produce desirable results as it struggles with frequencies greater than 16khz. I am currently designing a new horn for this project.

More to come soon...
